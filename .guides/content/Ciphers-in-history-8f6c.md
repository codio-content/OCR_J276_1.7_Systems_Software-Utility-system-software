Caesarâ€™s cipher is named after Julius Caesar who encrypted messages in the following way.
The letters of the alphabet are shifted to the right or left a set number of places. The number of the shift is called the key.
e.g. with a right key shift of 2, the alphabet would be changed to that shown on the bottom row:

The alphabet moves to the right and therefore the letters are replaced by those a set number of places to their left i.e. D will become B with a key of 2.

Notice how the letters at the end move to the start of the alphabet.
So if the message was:

- PLEASE SEND MORE TROOPS

The encrypted version would be:

- NJCYQC QCLB KMPC RPMMNQ

If the recipient knew the key used they could decrypt the message. To decrypt the message the letters would have to be shifted in the opposite direction.

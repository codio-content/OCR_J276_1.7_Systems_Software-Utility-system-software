Backing up data is essential for a computer user in case of file loss or corruption. Users often neglect to do this but every user eventually experiences data loss.

Backing up involves copying the files to a second medium such as disk, DVD or tape so that they can be restored if there are problems with the originals.

Backup programs, are included in systems software, and can be configured to back up sensitive data at specific times.
Often they also compress the data at the same time so that it takes up less storage space.

They can be configured to perform **full backups** where all of the specified data is backed up or **incremental** backups where only new files or ones that have changed since the last backup are saved in order to save time.

The software will manage the various backups, verify that the backed up files are identical to the originals and find a file if it needs to be restored.

File or data compression software uses algorithms to reduce the sizes of files.

The files therefore take up less storage space and can be transmitted over networks more quickly and using less bandwidth.

There are two types of compression â€“ lossless and lossy compression.

If a lossless compression algorithm is used to compress the file, then the original can be reconstituted when it is decompressed. Nothing is lost. This type of compression must be used when compressing text files as missing letters would make a document unreadable.

Lossy compression decreases the file size by deleting some of the data and unlike lossless compression, the original can never be reconstituted. It has been irreversibly changed.

There is more about compression in a later module (2.6 Data Representation)

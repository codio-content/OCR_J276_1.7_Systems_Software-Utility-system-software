In this lesson we will look at how the utility system software is used to maintain the smooth running of the computer.

The programs of the utility system perform specific tasks related to computer functions, resources, files and security. 

They help to configure the system, analyse how it is working and optimise it to improve its efficiency.

Here is a list of some common utility software:

| **Software**  | **Function**|

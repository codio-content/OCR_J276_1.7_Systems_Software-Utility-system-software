When a file is saved to disk, the operating system looks for free areas and parts of the file might be saved in different areas of the disk. They are said to be discontiguous. Over time a disk can become very fragmented when the different parts of lots of files are spread around the disk.

When the file is accessed the read/write heads of the hard disk drive have to seek the parts of the file over all areas of the disk so decreasing the access rate and generally slowing down the operation of the computer.

Disk fragmentation software rearranges the files on the disk so that all parts of a file are together. 

They separate parts are now contiguous and the complete file can be assessed more quickly.

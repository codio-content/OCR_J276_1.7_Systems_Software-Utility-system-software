Encryption software is used to scramble (encrypt) a file so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

The data is encrypted and then decrypted back to its original form using an algorithm called a cipher or key known only to the user.

Of course, the user must remember the encryption key!

A common method of encryption is the use of a ‘public’ and a ‘private’ key. 

- All users have both a public and a private key. 
- The public key is freely available to anyone but the private key is only known to the owner.
- Messages encrypted by a particular public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. 
- If person A wanted to send an encrypted fi le to person B, person A would encrypt it with person B’s public key. On receipt, person B would then decrypt the fi le with their private key.
